\usage{
compile(..., output = NULL, args = NULL, cores = 1, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more objects returned by \code{CppODE()} or
\code{funCpp()} that carry a \code{"srcfile"} attribute pointing to an
existing C or C++ source file.}

\item{output}{Optional base name for a combined shared library. If
supplied, all provided source files are compiled and linked into a
single shared object.}

\item{args}{Optional additional compiler or linker arguments passed to
\command{R CMD SHLIB}.}

\item{cores}{Number of parallel compilation jobs on Unix-like systems.
Ignored on Windows.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, show compiler commands and output.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} on successful compilation.

\description{
Compiles one or more C++ source files generated by \code{CppODE()} or
\code{funCpp()} into shared libraries (\code{.so}, \code{.dll}) using
\command{R CMD SHLIB}. Source files are located via the \code{"srcfile"}
attribute attached to the supplied objects.

Compilation is performed in the directory of each source file and does
not write to the user's home directory or working directory unless
explicitly requested by the user via the \code{outdir} argument when
generating the model code.

The function automatically applies platform-appropriate compiler flags
(e.g. C++20 standard, optimization, position-independent code where
required) and includes headers shipped with the package itself as well as
Boost headers provided by the \pkg{BH} package.

On Windows, compilation is always performed sequentially since
fork-based parallelism is unavailable.
