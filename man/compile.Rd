\title{Internal C++ model compiler}
\usage{
compile(..., output = NULL, args = NULL, cores = 1, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more model functions that have a \code{"modelname"}
attribute corresponding to a C++ source file
(e.g. \code{"funCpp0_ab12cd"}).}

\item{output}{Optional base name for the combined shared object.
If provided, all source files are compiled and linked into a single
shared library.}

\item{args}{Optional compiler or linker arguments (e.g. \code{"-lm"}).}

\item{cores}{Number of parallel compilation jobs (ignored on Windows).}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, show compiler output.}
}
\description{
Compiles one or more generated C++ source files (from \code{funCpp()} or
\code{CppFun()}) into shared libraries (*.so / *.dll) using
\code{R CMD SHLIB}. This is an internal helper and not intended for
direct user calls.
}
\details{
The function applies platform-appropriate C++ compiler flags
(e.g. C++20 standard, optimization, and position-independent code where
required) and includes headers shipped with the package itself.

Boost headers are provided via the BH package (declared in
\code{LinkingTo: BH}) and no system-installed Boost libraries are required.

On Windows, compilation is always performed sequentially since
fork-based parallelism is unavailable.

Each object must have a valid \code{modelname} attribute referring to an
existing \code{.cpp} or \code{.c} source file.
