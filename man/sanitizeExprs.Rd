\title{Sanitize expressions for SymPy compatibility}
\usage{
sanitizeExprs(exprs)
}
\arguments{
\item{exprs}{Character vector of expressions.}
}
\value{
Character vector with sanitized expressions.
}
\description{
Scans character expressions for reserved Python keywords and replaces them
with the same name plus an underscore appended.
}
\details{
Function names like \code{min}, \code{max}, \code{abs}, and \code{sum} are
left untouched, since they are valid in SymPy.

A warning is emitted for each replacement performed.
}
\examples{
sanitizeExprs("if + 1")   # becomes "if_ + 1"
