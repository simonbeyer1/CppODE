Description: This package provides a convenient R interface to generate, compile, and remember run C++ code for ODE models, with optional automatic differentiation support for first- and second-order sensitivity analysis. It includes an event handling framework that allows parameterized events (event parameters are included in the sensitivity calculation) to be specified using deSolve-style event logic, and supports both adaptive step size control and dense output for numerical integration.
