Description: Generates and compiles 'C++' code for solving systems of ordinary
    differential equations. Sensitivity analysis is supported via
    automatic differentiation using the 'FADBAD++' library. Numerical
    integration relies on the Boost C++ library. Event handling follows
    logic compatible with the 'deSolve' R package.
