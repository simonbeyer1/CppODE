Description: Generates and compiles 'C++' code for forward simulation of ordinary differential equation models.
    Numerical integration 'C++' library 'Boost.Numeric.Odeint'. First annd second order sensitivity computation is supported via automatic differentiation using the 'FADBAD++' library.
    For algebraic models, derivatives up to second order can be calculated analytically during the code generation process.
