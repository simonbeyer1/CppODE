Description: Generates and compiles C++ code for solving systems of 
    ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with automatic differentiation
    for sensitivity analysis. Uses Boost.Odeint for numerical integration
    and FADBAD++ for dual number arithmetic. Supports event handling
    via deSolve-style logic.
